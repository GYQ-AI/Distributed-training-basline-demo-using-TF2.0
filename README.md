# Distributed-training-basline-demo-using-TF2.0
This work is to create a runnable distributed training basline across multi-gpus with the purpose of accelerating the construction of any larger or more complex distributed deep learning projects on Tensorflow 2.0. 
A Grab-and-Go demo has been provided, please check script files and experimental snapshots (as below) for more details.
